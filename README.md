# bookie

The motivation for this project is to provide an easy way for my friends to track
their bets over time and compare their performance against each other.

Alternatively, I am using this project as a way to learn Haskell, GraphQL, and Vue.

Big shoutout to [dandoh](https://github.com/dandoh) for creating the [boilerplate](https://github.com/dandoh/web-haskell-graphql-postgres-boilerplate)
used to get up and running on this project quickly!
